<h1>Project Synapsys</h1>

In this project, I, Berk GÃ¶zek, will be documenting my progress of creating a Thunderbolt 4 Dock with the following ports:<p>
<ul>
	<li>4 USB C Ports with high-transfer speeds</li>
	<li>4 USB A 3.0 Ports</li>
	<li>2 HDMI Ports</li>
	<li>2 Mini Display Ports</li>
	<li>2 Display Ports</li>
	<li>A Regular SDHX Port</li>
	<li>A Mini SDHX Port</li>
	<li>A CFExpress Type A Port</li>
</ul>

<p>
The reason for doing such a project is that I could not find a docking station for my computer that provided both all I require and a good cost at the same time
<p>
This will also me the chance to add any and other ports in the process.
